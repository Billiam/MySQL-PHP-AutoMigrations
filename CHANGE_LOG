= VERSION 1.4.0 =

  * fixed bug: when using migration script on same database but different branches of a repository, migrations between rollups were being deleted; after rollup, file re-appeared but script thought it hadn't been run yet, tried to re-run it, and caused an error.

= VERSION 1.3.0 =

  * added --force option to the up, down, and latest commands; this will force the script to continue execution despite any migration errors that occur
  * added run command to allow the execution of a single migration

  * added current version number to ASCII header
